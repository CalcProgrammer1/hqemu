{"name":"HQEMU","tagline":"An Efficient and Retargetable Dynamic Binary Translator on Multicores","body":"### HQEMU\r\nHQEMU is a multi-threaded DBT prototype using QEMU (a popular retargetable DBT for system virtualization) and LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) as our building blocks. HQEMU could improve QEMU performance by a factor of 2.4X and 4X on the SPEC 2006 integer and floating point benchmarks for x86 to x86-64 emulations, respectively, i.e. it is only 2.5X and 2.1X slower than native execution of the same benchmarks on x86-64, as opposed to 6X and 8.4X slowdown on QEMU. For ARM to x86-64 emulation, HQEMU could gain a factor of 2.4X speedup over QEMU for the SPEC 2006 integer benchmarks.\r\n\r\nDemo Video:\r\n* [HQEMU User Mode with 32 threads](http://youtu.be/yDK-PKmqV10)\r\n\r\nyou can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n**2014.07.21: Release HQEMU-0.13**\r\n\r\n### Quickstart\r\nPlease refer to this document.
